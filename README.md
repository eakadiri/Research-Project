### Overview

*Emergency Rooms (ERs) handle an immense volume of patients daily, with a typical ER seeing up to 230 patients per day. The process involves multiple steps from patient intake to diagnosis and treatment, coordinated among doctors, nurses, and other medical staff. This paper explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically ChatGPT-4, can enhance this process by automating triage and improving decision-making and resource allocation. Using AI, emergency departments can potentially reduce the time patients spend waiting and increase the efficiency of medical service delivery. This paper explores the implications and limitations of using LLMs in the triage room and in medical contexts, broadly.
